Webscrapping:

Terminal:

Then open jupyter-notebook

scrapping practice:

	-library
	
	-beautifulsoup
	
	-import it
	
	-bs4 beautifulsoup
	
	-import requests
	
	-hide/show data
	
	-for hidden data use request library
	
	-goibibo.com/robots.txt
	
	-it will give the scrapping data that we can scrap from a site
	
	-Look allow and disallow
	
	-by import requests libray we can request them to give us disallow data as well
	
	-with open is used to open a file 
	
	-r is used to read 
	
	-import it in variable 
	
	-store it in content varaible 
	
	-make soup variable 
	
	-soup=BeautifulSoup(content,'lxml')
	
	-print(soup)
	
	-it will print all the code of html file
	
	-soup.prettify() is used to prettify the code
	
Now we will do findings:

	-tag=soup.find('h5')
	
	-print(tag)
	
	-it will print the tag
	
	-anchor tag (a) is multiple in a code
	
	-first anchor tag will be returned
	
	-findall command is used to print all anchor tags
	
	-tag=soup.findall('a')
	 print(tag)
	
	-this is the command to find all anchor tags
	
	-For the content only
	
	-use print(tag.text) to get the content only
	
	-to get the text of multiple h5
	
	-use for loop

	-tag=soup.find_all('h5')
	 for writting in tag:
	 	print(writting.text)
	 	
	 -it will print the content of all the h5 tags
